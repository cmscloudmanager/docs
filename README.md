# CMS Cloud Manager documentation

The CMS Cloud Manager project is a tool created at the Cloudfest Hackathon 2025 by @BrutalBirdie, @commitnix, @nixautomatix, and @markoheijnen, and led by @Hayajiro, and @JavierCasares

The project is a tool that, in addition to installing a specific CMS, allows for the creation and setup of a server for optimal performance, taking security and efficiency into account.
